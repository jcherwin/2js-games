# 2JS-games

## Description

We created `2js-games` because we wanted to make a online webpage and game platform that would allow friends to play multiplayer games online.

We wanted to create a application that allows for a user to create an account, join a multiplayer game, and have the ability to view a record of their wins and losses.

Over the course of this project, the team gained an in-depth understanding of `graphQl subscriptions`, `useEffects`, `Hooks`, `MongoDb`, and the `React App`. Using the afore mentioned resources along with many others. A full stack game website was created, and as a whole, the teams gained a significantly deeper understanding of each of the projects components and how the interact with each other.

## User Story

AS A user with the desire to play games with friends,
I WANT an application to host games that users can play
SO THAT I can play games online with friends.

- Given a game website
    - WHEN a user tries to access the website for the first time
    - THEN they are prompted to sign up with a username and password
    - WHEN the user selects a game to play
    - THEN a unique “room” is created
    - WHEN a user enters a room number
    - THEN a user is admitted to a created room with another user
    - WHEN a user wins or loses a game
    - THEN the game and result is stored to that user
    - WHEN the data is stored
    - THEN the users are prompted to play again
    - WHEN one user wishes not to play again
    - THEN the user is sent to the homepage
